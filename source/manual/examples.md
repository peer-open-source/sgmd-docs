# Examples


  - Figure 3 shows a search for all ground motions in Realizations 1 and 2, and Realizations with patches 4 and 5 within a region defined by latitude boundaries of $37.68^{\circ}$ and $37.72^{\circ}$ and longitude boundaries of $-122.30^{\circ}$ and $-121.90^{\circ}$.
  - Figure 4 shows a search for all ground motions in the same region, but only those with $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{s} 30}$ between $300 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $500 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
  - Figure 5 shows a search for all ground motions in the same region but only those with $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{s} 30}$ between $300 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $500 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, and $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{jb}}$ between 10 km and 20 km .
  - Figure 6 shows a search for all ground motions with PGV between $0.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $1.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in Realizations 1-10, and Realizations with Patches 1-10.
