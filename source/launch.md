The Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) â€“ Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Simulated Ground Motion Database (SGMD) includes a large set of simulated ground motions generated from physics-based, deterministic, broad-band earthquake simulations. 
These simulated ground motions in the database have undergone careful validation, including comparisons against recorded ground motions from actual earthquakes.
