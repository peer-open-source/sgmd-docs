# Overview

The Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) â€“ Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Simulated Ground Motion Database (SGMD) includes a large set of simulated ground motions generated from physics-based, deterministic, broad-band earthquake simulations. These simulated ground motions in the database have undergone careful validation, including comparisons against recorded ground motions from actual earthquakes. The PEER-LBNL SGMD is one of the few simulated ground motion databases globally and is anticipated to enable engineers to utilize validated simulated ground motions in seismically active regions in the U.S. and around the world..

The development and maintenance of SGMD is supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) and LBNL under award number 056892.
